# Research

## Project Aim
It is the objective of this project to make research more efficient and effective by reviewing a large number of articles on a specific topic and categorizing the information accordingly.

## How to use
As of now, there is no user interface. Therefore, in the ethical class, you can simply specify the topic variable as the name of the topic you wish to research, and it will return information about that topic. Although it is not yet a completed project, it is fairly accurate most of the time.
